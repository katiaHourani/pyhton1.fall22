# Welcome to Python Kitchen!
# This week you will use your newly learned knowledge of lists, tuples, dictionaries 
# and sorting to create a simulation of a restaurant. 
# Your code will be able to print menus, take orders and more. 

# Here is a list of dishes Python Kitchen provides. It is a list of tuples.
# Each tuple has information of one dish in order: (Number, Name, Price, Origin, Whether is vegetarian)
dishes=[(1,'Salmon Sushi', 30, 'Japan', False), 
        (2,'Pork Dumplings', 25, 'China', False), 
        (3,'Choziro Tacos', 20, 'Mexico', False),
        (4, 'Chickpea Curry', 36, 'India', True),
        (5, 'Apple Pie', 16, 'USA', True),
        (6, 'Jollof Rice', 18, 'Nigeria', False),
        (7, 'Dolma', 45, 'Azerbaijan', False),
        (8, 'Vegetable Pho', 25, 'Vietnam', True),
        (9, 'Kvass', 12, 'Russia',  True),
        (10, 'Luau', 30, 'Samoa', True)]

# # TODO: Put the dishes into this dictionary. The key of the dictionary is the dish's name, the value is the dish's price.
# # Example: Salmon Sushi: 30
# # USE LOOPS: Think about how you can use loops to automate this process for you instead of hardcoding all the dishes

        ** Tips: convert the inputs into the right format
        The tuple is (Number, Name, Price, Origin, Whether is vegetarian).
